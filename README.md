# AB Test: Linear, Logistic, and Probit Models

Welcome to the AB Test repository for comparing linear, logistic, and probit models! This project focuses on conducting an AB test to evaluate the performance of three different models in a statistical experiment. Whether you're a data scientist, researcher, or someone interested in model comparison, this code provides insights into analyzing the effectiveness of linear, logistic, and probit models.

## Features

- **AB Test Framework:** Implement an AB test framework to compare the performance of three models across different metrics.

- **Linear Model:** Apply a linear regression model to analyze the impact of variables on the response variable.

- **Logistic Model:** Utilize a logistic regression model for binary classification, assessing the probability of an event occurring.

- **Probit Model:** Implement a probit regression model, an alternative to logistic regression, to model binary outcomes.

- **Metrics and Evaluation:** Assess the models' performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
